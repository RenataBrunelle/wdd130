            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Rafting Adventure was born in 2012, when a group of friends passionate about extreme sports decided to
                turn their
                passion for rapids into a life project. Located on the banks of the Rio das Pedras, the company started
                with just two
                boats and a great desire to show the public the beauty and strength of nature. Over time,
                professionalism, care for
                safety and environmental commitment made Rafting Adventure a reference in adventure tourism in the
                region. Today, the
                company offers complete experiences that go beyond rafting, integrating ecotourism, environmental
                education and
                experiences of personal improvement, always with the team spirit and emotion that define its essence.
